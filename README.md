# ConversationalBot-Restaurant
An Indian startup named 'Foodie' wants to build a conversational bot (chatbot) which can help users discover restaurants across several Indian cities. The main purpose of the bot is to help users discover restaurants quickly and efficiently and to provide a good restaurant discovery experience. Zomato apis are used for searching the restaurants. https://developers.zomato.com/documentation#/ Assuming that Foodie works for Tier-1 and Tier-2 restaurants build chatbot that asks for cuisine preferences , location and budget and return top 5 restaurants in sorted order of the average Zomato user rating(Scale 1-5). Send the details of the top 10 restaurants to userâ€™s email if he asks for it. Using Rasa framework build a bot. Also handle the specific nuances of the conversation and greetings in graceful fashion. At last deploy the model on slack and make a you tube video showcasing conversations.
